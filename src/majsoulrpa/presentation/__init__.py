"""Provides presentation classes.

In this context, a *presentation* refers to a specific screen state of
the game. Each presentation acts as both the View and Controller in the
MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. As the View, it is tasked with
detecting and recognizing the screen state. As the Controller, it
manages interactions with widgets on the screen.
